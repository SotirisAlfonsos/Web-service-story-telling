# Web service story telling
The idea came from a course during my Bachelors degree in Greece. It is a web service that lets users create stories and 
edit them in a world map. A story may have several steps and consists of places on the map, where its place may have pictures or text. 
A user also has the ability to view other user's stories as they appear in the homepage in a chronological order.
